The contents of the file /paylyt-platform/paylyt-platform/frontend/public should include the main HTML file for the frontend application, typically named index.html. Here is the content for that file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>PayLyt - Bitcoin Lightning Payment Platform</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="%PUBLIC_URL%/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

This file serves as the entry point for the React application, where the root div is where the React components will be rendered. The script tag links to the main JavaScript file that will be generated during the build process.
