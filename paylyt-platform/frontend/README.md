# PayLyt Frontend Documentation

## Overview

The PayLyt frontend is built using React and Bootstrap, providing a user-friendly interface for clients and freelancers to interact with the PayLyt platform. This application allows clients to post jobs, make payments, and approve deliverables, while freelancers can accept jobs, submit work, and convert their earnings from Bitcoin to local currency.

## Project Structure

The frontend project is organized as follows:

- **public/**: Contains static assets such as images and the main HTML file.
- **src/**: The main source directory for the application.
  - **components/**: Reusable React components for the UI.
  - **pages/**: Page components representing different views.
  - **hooks/**: Custom React hooks for state management and side effects.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions specific to the frontend.
  - **styles/**: CSS/SCSS files for styling components.
- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests for the frontend components.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts.
- **.env.example**: Template for environment variables required by the frontend application.

3. **Environment Variables**

## Project Flow

The core flow of the PayLyt platform is as follows:

1. **Client Posts Job**: The client creates a job with a title, description, amount, and deadline.
2. **Client Pays**: Upon job acceptance, the client pays via a Lightning invoice generated by the backend.
3. **PayLyt Holds the Money**: The payment is confirmed, and the funds are held securely until the job is completed.
4. **Freelancer Completes Job**: The freelancer submits the deliverables through the platform.
5. **Client Approves**: The client reviews the work and approves the release of payment.
6. **PayLyt Releases Payment Instantly**: The backend processes the payout to the freelancer's wallet.
7. **Freelancer Converts Bitcoin**: The freelancer can convert their Bitcoin earnings to local currency or withdraw them.

## Component Usage

- **Job Posting Page**: Allows clients to create and manage job postings.
- **Freelancer Dashboard**: Displays available jobs and submission status.
- **Admin Panel**: Provides administrative controls for managing users and jobs.
