# PayLyt Project Flow

This document explains the end-to-end flow of the PayLyt platform for all team members.

---

## Overview

PayLyt is a Bitcoin Lightning payment platform for freelance jobs. It ensures secure, escrow-based payments between clients and freelancers, with instant release and optional BTC-to-fiat conversion.

## High-Level Flow

1. **Client Posts Job**
   - Client creates a job (title, description, amount in local currency & BTC, deadline, milestones).

2. **Freelancer Accepts Job**
   - Freelancer views job, accepts terms, and is assigned to the job.

3. **Client Pays**
   - Platform generates a Lightning invoice (via Bitnob API).
   - Client pays using QR code or payment link.

4. **Funds Held by PayLyt**
   - Upon payment confirmation (Bitnob webhook), funds are marked as “held” (paid_locked) in the system.
   - Freelancer is notified that payment is secured.

5. **Freelancer Completes Work**
   - Freelancer submits deliverables through the platform.

6. **Client Approves Work**
   - Client reviews deliverables and clicks “Approve Release.”

7. **PayLyt Releases Payment**
   - Platform initiates payout via Bitnob API.
   - Funds are released instantly to the freelancer’s wallet.

8. **Freelancer Converts or Withdraws**
   - Freelancer can convert BTC to local currency (via Bitnob) and withdraw to bank/mobile money, or keep/invest BTC.

9. **Audit & Notifications**
   - Both parties receive receipts.
   - All actions are logged for transparency and dispute resolution.
